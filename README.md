# Music_match
Digital Music Match project 

Description
From 2015-2019 a colleague in a different section of the National Library of New
Zealand (NLNZ) downloaded over 700 digital music releases in scope for the
collection. Two colleagues at the NLNZ are going to use programmatic methods
to assess whether:
1. There is a record in our collection management system and we have archived
the release
2. There is a record in our collection management system and we have not
archived the release
Resources:
- Metadata file A of not yet processed Bandcamp digital releases (data
extracted from audio files)
- Metadata file B of all digital music records in our collection management
system
- Script(s) to check if release in A is found in B
- Raw results files
- Data file maintained of confirmed matches
I will be working with my colleague Rhonda Grantham on this project.
